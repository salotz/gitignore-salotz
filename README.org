* gitignore

Using the same structure as the [[https://github.com/toptal/gitignore]]
repo just adding my own.

Because the templates support:

- stacks
- patches
- order

Composition effective use of these will require a application to do
this for us, which doesn't exist yet.

The best one so far for python is
[[https://github.com/lagerfeuer/gitignore]]:

#+begin_src bash
pip install giig
#+end_src
